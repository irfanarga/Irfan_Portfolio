# [Project 1. Basic Feature Discovering for Machine Learning: Overview](https://github.com/irfanarga/Basic-Feature-Discovering-for-Machine-Learning)
* The goals are comparing the model with feature engineering and without feature engineering 
* Using Titanic dataset from Kaggle and set Survived variable as the target
* Makes feature engineering by adding an extra column to increasing model accurate
* Using Random Forest Classification and cross_val_score to measuring model accurate
