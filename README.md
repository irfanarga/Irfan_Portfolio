# [Project 1. Basic Feature Discovering for Machine Learning: Overview](https://github.com/irfanarga/Basic-Feature-Discovering-for-Machine-Learning)
* The goal is comparing between model accuration with feature engineering and without feature engineering 
* Using Titanic dataset from Kaggle and set Survived variable as target
* Make feature engineering by add extra column to increasing model accuration
* Using Random Forest Classification and Cross Val Score to measuring model accuration
